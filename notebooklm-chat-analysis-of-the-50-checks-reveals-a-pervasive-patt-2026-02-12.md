Analysis of the 50 checks reveals a pervasive pattern of financial irregularities and potential fraud. While the check documents themselves appear to be authentic Axis Bank Ltd instruments, the handwritten data and authorizations contain several critical "red flags."

The main problems identified in the sources are summarized below:

### 1\. Systematic Signature Forgery

The most severe problem is that **the person authorized to pay (the drawer) is often not the one signing the check.** In a legitimate transaction, Rajarshi Pal must sign to authorize the funds; however, in a majority of these checks, **the payee (the recipient) has signed their own name in the signatory box.**

• **Signatures matching Payees:** Check 309105 is payable to **Sunil Gopal Jhu** and is signed "**Sunil**"\[1\]. Check 309157 is payable to **Sunil Kumar** and is signed "**Sunil**"\[2\]. Check 309106 is payable to **Aditya Chinpudu Rao** and is signed "**Aditya**"\[3\].

• **Third-Party Signatories:** In check 309104, the payee is Pravin Teja, but the signature belongs to an entirely different person, "**M. Sandhy**"\[4\].

• **Inconsistency:** These signatures stand in stark contrast to checks like 309135 or 309148, which appear to be signed by the actual account holder, "**R. Pal**"\[5\]\[6\].

### 2\. Discrepancies Between Words and Figures

Several checks contain **conflicting information regarding the amount to be paid**, which is a common indicator of "check raising" or alteration fraud.

• **Check 309133:** The amount in words is "**one crore one lakh**," while the numerical box specifies only "**₹ 11,00,000/-**" (Eleven Lakh)\[7\].

• **Check 309134:** The amount in words is "**two crore two lakh**," but the numerical box contains "**₹ 22,00,000/-**" (Twenty Two Lakh)\[8\].

### 3\. Extreme and Irregular Valuations

The checks fluctuate between standard personal amounts and **astronomical sums** that are highly unusual for a single personal account.

• **High-Value Checks:** Check 309113 is for **₹ 110,00,00,000** (One hundred ten crores)\[9\], and check 309112 is for **₹ 62,00,00,000** (Sixty two crores)\[10\].

• **Volume vs. Value:** These billion-rupee figures are issued from the same sequence as checks for as little as **₹ 10,000**\[11\] or **₹ 23,500**\[12\], which is typical behavior in money laundering or "shell" account scams.

### 4\. Chronological and Sequential Anomalies

The checks are not issued in a logical timeline according to their serial numbers, suggesting they may have been **backdated** or issued from a pre-signed, out-of-order book.

• **Backdating:** Check 309115 is dated **January 2015**\[13\], even though check 309105 (ten numbers earlier in the book) is dated **January 2016**\[1\].

• **Large Gaps:** Check 309157 is dated **May 2016**\[2\], while checks appearing later in the sequence, such as 309158, are dated **December 2015**\[14\].

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Analogy for Understanding:**Using these checks is like trying to use a **stolen credit card** where you haven't even bothered to learn the owner's name; the "card" (the check) is real, but because you are signing your own name instead of the owner's, the entire transaction is fundamentally invalid and points toward a deliberate attempt to bypass security.
